Moves an upcoming Booking to different upcoming Event in Events Manager with a simple select dropdown.

== Description ==
> Requires [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/) (free plugin) to be installed & activated.

**Easily move Events Manager Bookings from one Event to another.**
Do you ever need "rebook a booking" and find that deleting the existing booking and creating a new one manually is just cumbersome? If so, this little add-on for Events Manager makes that extremely easy!

Just go to the single booking page in your WordPress Admin of the booking you want to move. <em>(That is exact same page as where you can change the booking status and/or edit details.)</em>
There you will find a new section, just below the event details. Simply select new upcoming event from the dropdown list, click the "Move Booking" button and you are done.
Remember to notify your customer by using the "Resend Booking Email" button in the same page.

Since version 2.0 the dropdown list will be populated as:
`#_EVENTDATES @ #_EVENTTIMES | #_EVENTNAME`

If manual overbooking is not allowed in your Events Manager settings, the Move Booking dropdown list will not include them.

There are no settings to configure. Just activate the add-on. That's it.

**Important to know:**
1. This is a back-end only add-on. Moving a single booking can not be done from "My Bookings" in the front-end.

2. Different Ticket Types & Prices are not beging checked.
This add-on only checks the ticket availability of the new event. If bookings are open and there are enough spaces left, the booking will be moved.
If you are using (lots of) different ticket types and prices, this may not be the right add-on for you.
